Welcome to the BashCraft website! This project is a student-led initiative at VIT Bhopal aimed at fostering technical innovation and creativity among students. The website serves as a platform to share information about the club, its events, and how to get involved.

This repository contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for the BashCraft website

## Overview of the Code

### `index.html`

This is the main HTML file for the website. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its structure:

- **DOCTYPE and HTML Tag**: The document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, indicating that it is an HTML5 document. The `<html>` tag specifies the language as English (`lang="en"`).

- **Head Section**: 
  - The `<head>` section contains metadata, including the character set and viewport settings for responsive design.
  - A title is defined as "Club Events."
  - The `<link>` tag connects to an external CSS file (`style.css`) for styling, along with internal CSS styles defined within `<style>` tags.

- **Body Section**: 
  - The `<body>` contains the main content of the website wrapped in a `.container` div for central alignment.
  - **Logo Section**: Displays the BashCraft logo with a link to the homepage.
  - **Header**: Contains the main heading (`<h1>`) and a brief description (`<p>`).
  
- **Icon Section**: 
  - A flexbox layout displays three icons representing different sections: About Us, Previous Events, and Upcoming Events.
  - Each icon has an `onclick` event that scrolls smoothly to the respective section when clicked.

- **Sections**:
  - **About Us**: Describes the mission and vision of BashCraft.
  - **Previous Events**: Lists events that have already occurred, providing dates and descriptions.
  - **Upcoming Events**: Highlights future events and what participants can expect.

- **Footer Section**: 
  - Includes links to social media platforms for BashCraft and a copyright statement.

### CSS Styles

The styles are defined both in the external `style.css` and within the `<style>` tag in `index.html`. Key styling features include:

- **Background Gradient**: The body has a gradient background that transitions from black to a shade of green.
- **Responsive Design**: The `.container` class ensures content is centered and maintains a maximum width.
- **Icon Effects**: Icons scale up slightly on hover for a visual effect.
- **Event Cards**: Each event is styled with a border and background color, making them visually distinct.
